# Configuring DHCP in Docker Compose

You can establish a DHCP service for IP allocation in Docker Compose networks by doing:

```yaml
networks:

  pentestnet:  

    driver: bridge
    
    ipam:
    
      driver: default
      
      config:
      
        - subnet: 172.30.1.0/24
        
          ip_range: 172.30.1.128/25
        
          gateway: 172.30.1.1
```

This will:

- Define a network `pentestnet` with a bridge driver
- The default IPAM driver will manage IP allocation
- Specify a subnet range of 172.30.1.0/24  
- Allocate IPs from range 172.30.1.128-172.30.1.255  
- Set gateway to 172.30.1.1

## Benefits

Containers on this network will:

- Get an IP automatically from the specified pool  
- Be able to communicate through the defined gateway
- Mimic a real networked environment

You can configure multiple networks this way to simulate full network topologies.

This enables docker-compose to mimic a DHCP server, handing out addresses from predefined ranges.
