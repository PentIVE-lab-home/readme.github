# Docker at Home Cybersecurity Lab
A home cybersecurity lab is extremely beneficial to cybersecurity students because it allows for hands-on skill development and experimentation in a secure, legal environment utilizing actual systems and assaults. Docker allows for easy deployment across platforms.

## Advantages
The following are the primary benefits of a home cybersecurity lab:  

### Real-World Experience
* Experiment with real-world vulnerabilities such as operating system (OS) command injections, unsecured misconfigurations, port exposes, and so on. Understand attack strategies by deliberately compromising lab systems in a controlled manner * Blueprint real-world attacks without actually causing any damage

### Legal Environment That Is Secure  
* Experiment freely with hacking tools, exploits, malware, and so on without fear of repercussions * Develop offensive security skills such as post-exploitation strategies in an ethical setting * Improve defensive skills by attempting to protect lab systems from oneself  

### Disposable and portable
* Use Docker to effortlessly spin up sophisticated multi-system lab settings; * Destroy and restart lab infrastructure without affecting the host machine; and * Switch between lab configurations to simulate different scenarios.

### Low Cost * No need for numerous physical machines - use containers to run complete labs on a single host Self-hosting environments can help you save money on cloud infrastructure. Reusing baseline images allows you to swiftly rebuild systems as needed.

## Docker Architecture
Some best practices for Docker home labs:  

* Use Docker Compose to easily define and manage environments.
* Create virtual networks to simulate subnet topologies and restrict access * Follow host hardening guidance to contain and limit lab risks * Integrate continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to keep lab infrastructure as code
